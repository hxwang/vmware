## VM live migration


### Summary
- In vCenter, create a cluster, and add the hosts to the cluster
- The above step will add the hosts and the vms into the panel
- On the panel, select a vm, right click to choose the "migrate" option
- We can use a "ping -f vm-ip" command on another vm to test the downtime during vm migration
